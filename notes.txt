Current issues: 


Questions: 
- the year does not appear anywhere: that ok? put it next to first month?
- how will the lines on side appear?

Current decisions: 
- use date-fns for manipulations instead of writing my own functions
   - e.g. for week number
   - less likely to make mistakes
   - easier to expand, e.g. other languages
?- use an array with dates between date-fns and svg code
   + structured around pages, e.g. no need to look forward to count number of rows
   + work independently on SVG part, then rework the numbers part
   + easier to access, e.g. page.weeks, week.number ...
   + need to spit out a greedy object with all info
   + easier to debug and remeber later how it works
?- could work from dates directly
   + do not need add to both SVG and numbers for e.g. "Week 52" vs "53" on 2nd and 3rd rows
   + no need to rewrite numbers part after   
   x vertical lines can be applied by month or in one piece
   x same work if switch stack: need both numbers and SVG always anyway (lots of rewrite in both cases)
   



Ideas for future: 
- consider locales: e.g. selecting language
