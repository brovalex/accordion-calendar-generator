Todo: 
* weeks_count_i not calculating properly e.g. march 2018 too many, october 2018 too few
- Make exception for very last week: need to remove month header + add back week number
- Height of last month will be off by 1 week because it may include the first of the following month
- h needs to be adjusted because not static depending on number of weeks

Questions: 
- the year does not appear anywhere: that ok? put it next to first month?
- how will the lines on side appear?
- with current resolution, height division may lead to rounding errors where 1px is quite a bit in print

Current decisions: 
- use date-fns for manipulations instead of writing my own functions
   - e.g. for week number
   - less likely to make mistakes
   - easier to expand, e.g. other languages
?- use an array with dates between date-fns and svg code
   + structured around pages, e.g. no need to look forward to count number of rows
   + work independently on SVG part, then rework the numbers part
   + easier to access, e.g. page.weeks, week.number ...
   + need to spit out a greedy object with all info
   + easier to debug and remeber later how it works
?- could work from dates directly
   + do not need add to both SVG and numbers for e.g. "Week 52" vs "53" on 2nd and 3rd rows
   + no need to rewrite numbers part after   
   x vertical lines can be applied by month or in one piece
   x same work if switch stack: need both numbers and SVG always anyway (lots of rewrite in both cases)
- checking the ISO week of the given week's Thursday (not first day of week), this is consistent with ISO but could be misleading if someone relies on e.g. what ISO week is Monday or Sunday --- ask Russel
   



Ideas for future: 
- consider locales: e.g. selecting language
