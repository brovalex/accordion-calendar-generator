Printing bigging on July 3, 2023: the print is slightly oversized

- Print at 98% (97.56) so that calendar is actually 7.5in wide
    - Note: it rounded the percentage to 98, but I'm not sure if it actually took the full decimal, 97% is a bit small, and 98% is a bit bigger than desired, but 98% overall better
- To avoid top being croped, set paper lenght to 1776.5mm wide (i.e. 36.5mm more than the document size of 1740mm)
